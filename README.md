# Array Explorer and Binary Mirror

This Python script provides a collection of functions for array manipulation and binary operations. It allows you to perform various tasks such as finding elements in an array using XOR, finding repeating elements, finding odd occurring elements, swapping variables without using a third variable, and checking if the binary representation of a number is a palindrome.

## Features

- Find elements in an array using XOR: This function takes an array as input and returns the XOR of all elements in the array.
- Find repeating elements in an array: This function identifies the repeating elements in an array and returns them as a list.
- Find odd occurring elements in an array: This function finds all the elements that occur an odd number of times in an array and returns them as a list.
- Swap variables without using a third variable: This function demonstrates how to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
- Check if the binary representation of a number is a palindrome: This function takes a number as input and checks if its binary representation is a palindrome.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   
   python array_explorer_binary_mirror.py

4. The script will display a menu with different options. Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation.
5. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary inputs for each operation.
6. The script will execute the selected operation and display the results.
7. You can choose to perform multiple operations or exit the program by selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

## Example

===========================================================

Menu:
1. Find elements in an array using XOR
2. Find repeating elements in an array
3. Find all odd occurring elements in an array
4. Swap variables without using a third variable
5. Check if the binary representation of a number is a palindrome
6. Exit

===========================================================

Enter your choice (1-6):
2
Please provide an array (space-separated integers): 1 2 3 4 2 3 5

Repeating elements found in your array: {2, 3}

Repeating elements found in your array: {2, 3}

In this example, the user selected option 2 to find repeating elements in an array. They provided the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5]`, and the script identified the repeating elements as `{2, 3}`.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to handle invalid user inputs. If the user enters a non-integer value when an integer is expected, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
